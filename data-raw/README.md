# data-raw

This folder is for **repeatable data build scripts** that generate the frozen snapshot
bundled with the Shiny app under `app/data/`.

## Current State
- `build_snapshot.R` is the main entrypoint and is implemented.
- The app ships with a **frozen snapshot** under `app/data/` generated by the build script.
- Optional: attendance-zone build helpers:
  - `build_zone_sources.R` seeds a registry of top divisions by enrollment.
  - `build_zones_sabs.R` / `build_zones_division_sources.R` can generate optional
    zone polygons under `app/data/zones/` when boundary data is available.

## Intended Inputs (Future)
Place authoritative raw downloads under `data-raw/input/`, for example:
- VDOE School Quality Profile exports (school-level performance + discipline + demographics)
- A stable school identifier crosswalk (state IDs + NCES IDs)
- Division boundaries (polygons) suitable for choropleth mapping

See `build_snapshot.R` for the current set of downloads/transformations and `docs/DATA_SCHEMA.md`
for the snapshot schema.
